        <p class="paragraph-3 light">This page elaborates on some of the no-code development platforms we use to build
          your bespoke automations for those who are curious. Why would we reveal the inner workings of our business,
          when people could learn to build the automations themselves?<br><br>The answer is explained with a simple
          analogy. You can surely change the oil in your own car, but do you? Learning any one of these platforms in
          isolation is like changing your own oil. Hiring Bigger Fish is like getting an oil change plus your tires
          rotated, fluids topped off, filters replaced, and a multi-point inspection. Learning to do all this is a
          full-time job. Leave it to us, you&#x27;ve got bigger fish to fry. </p>
